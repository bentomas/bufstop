1. INTRODUCTION                                    *bufstop-introduction*

|Bufstop| is a plugin for fast buffer switching, built for efficiency and less 
keystrokes.

It provides a |:Bufstop| command that opens a new window at the bottom of the 
screen containing the list of current buffers (ordered by most recently used).
Each buffer has an associated hotkey displayed besides it. When the hotkey is
pressed, the buffer is loaded in preview mode (it's opened in the most 
recent window without closing the |Bufstop| window).

Bufstop is more efficient than the native |:ls| comamnd, since it can be used
to quickly preview opened files without closing the buffer list, and in 
general it requires less key strokes to open a buffer than other plugins.

The |Bufstop| window is easily dismissed with the <Esc> key.

This plugin also provides navigation history for each window. Use the 
|:BufstopForward| and |:BufstopBack| commands to quickly navigate the buffers
in the order they were opened.

Recommended |vimrc| mappings for these commands:
>
    map <leader>b :Bufstop<CR>
    map <C-tab>   :BufstopBack<CR>
    map <S-tab>   :BufstopForward<CR>
